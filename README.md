## 🔒 Security

### Encryption Details

All commands are encrypted using **AES-256 in CBC mode** before transmission:

```
Plaintext:  ACS01|Path-A|start|executor.py
              ↓
          AES-256 Encrypt
              ↓
Ciphertext: dmFsaWRfYmFzZTY0X2VuY29kZWRfZGF0YQ==
```

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The default encryption keys in `crypto.py` are for **demonstration only**. 
> **Replace them with secure, randomly generated keys before production deployment.**

### Best Practices for Production

1. **Key Management**
   - Use environment variables for keys
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Store keys in secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS)

2. **Authentication**
   - Replace hardcoded credentials with database authentication
   - Implement JWT tokens for session management
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force

3. **Network Security**
   - Deploy behind HTTPS/TLS
   - Use VPN for vehicle communication
   - Implement IP whitelisting

4. **Data Protection**
   - Sanitize all inputs
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Enable SQL injection prevention

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- GPS hardware (optional, for vehicle clients)
- Flutter SDK 3.0+ (for mobile app)

### Server Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ACS_Sec

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

### Vehicle Client Setup

```bash
# On each vehicle/device
cd ACS_Sec

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure vehicle ID in vehicle_client.py
# Edit line 15: ACS_ID = "ACS01"  # Change to unique ID

# Configure server URL
# Edit line 14: SERVER_URL = "http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000"

# Run the client
python vehicle_client.py
```

### Flutter Mobile App Setup

```bash
cd flutter_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Configure server URL in lib/main.dart
# Edit line 10: const String SERVER_URL = "http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000";

# Run on device/emulator
flutter run
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Server Configuration (`app.py`)

```python
# Default vehicles (update coordinates as needed)
CARS = {
    "ACS01": {"lat": 17.601838, "lon": 78.126866, "status": "Stopped", "path": "Path-A"},
    "ACS02": {"lat": 17.601938, "lon": 78.126966, "status": "Stopped", "path": "Path-B"},
    "ACS03": {"lat": 17.601738, "lon": 78.126766, "status": "Stopped", "path": "Path-C"},
}

# Admin credentials (CHANGE THESE!)
USERNAME = "admin"
PASSWORD = "admin123"  # Use strong password + hashing in production
```

### Vehicle Client Configuration (`vehicle_client.py`)

```python
# Server connection
SERVER_URL = "http://192.168.1.100:5000"  # Update to your server IP

# Unique vehicle identifier
ACS_ID = "ACS01"  # Must match a key in server's CARS dictionary

# GPS hardware settings (if using physical GPS)
GPS_PORT = "/dev/ttyACM0"      # Serial port for GPS
GPS_BAUDRATE = 38400            # Baud rate
GPS_TIMEOUT = 1                 # Read timeout in seconds
```

### Encryption Keys (`crypto.py`)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Replace these before production!

```python
# Generate secure 32-byte key for AES-256
SECRET_KEY = os.urandom(32)

# Generate secure 16-byte IV
IV = os.urandom(16)
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Access the Web Dashboard

Navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000`

- View **live fleet status** on satellite map
- See only **running vehicles** (stopped vehicles hidden)
- Monitor GPS coordinates, status, and active paths

### 2. Admin Panel Login

Navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000/login`

**Default Credentials:**

- Password: `admin123`

> ⚠️ **Change these immediately in production!**

### 3. Control Vehicles

From the admin panel:

1. **Select a vehicle** (ACS01, ACS02, ACS03)
2. **Choose a path** from dropdown
3. **Click START** to begin autonomous operation
4. **Click STOP** to halt the vehicle

Commands are encrypted and queued for the vehicle to fetch.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server Issues

**Problem**: Server won't start
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is already in use
sudo lsof -i :5000

# Kill existing process
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Or run on different port
flask run --port 8080
```

**Problem**: GPS data not updating
- Verify vehicle client is running
- Check `SERVER_URL` matches actual server IP
- Ensure firewall allows port 5000

### Vehicle Client Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to GPS
```python
# Check available serial ports
python -m serial.tools.list_ports

# Update GPS_PORT in vehicle_client.py
```

**Problem**: Commands not executing
- Verify `ACS_ID` matches server configuration
- Check encryption keys match between server and client
- Ensure `decrypt_execute` function is working

### Mobile App Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to server
- Verify `SERVER_URL` in `main.dart`
- Ensure server is accessible from mobile device
- Check network firewall settings
